WooF is a free JDBC driver for accessing FileMaker Server from Java applications. Compared to the standard JDBC driver that ships with FileMaker, it is smaller, more standards-compliant, and open source.

In addition to the JDBC driver, WooF is packaged with a compatibility layer for using FileMaker with WebObjects.

WooF is a GPL (GNU Public License) open source application.
